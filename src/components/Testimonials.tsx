They sent me the itinerary early enough for me to plan and responded to my mails within minutes. We were picked on time at our pick up point and the tour guide/driver (Lawrence) was friendly. My safari was amazing and beautiful and I actually learnt some new words from Lawrence. I just lover the way he answered my a thousand questions to mean he is conversant with the tour industry.If you wish to travel, I would recommend you choose Britex. Britex is a stay for me.",

My fiance and I were looking for company that would cater for our budget honeymoon diani beach package, it was at this time that a friend of mine informed me to try Britex, and I decided to give it a try, the company provided the best package and up to now I will never regret choosing them, they have great customer care and whenever I travel r go on a safari with them I usually get ndovu points which I can redeem for either a air ticket or shopping",
